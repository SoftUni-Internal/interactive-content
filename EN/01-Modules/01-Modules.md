# What are Modules?

A **Module** is a **set of functions** that is made **accessible throughout any part of the application**.

Modules are used to **encapsulate code and data** in order to **implement a certain functionality**.

Most often, **modules** are packaged in a **single unit**, so that they are **easier to deploy**.

There are numerous **benefits** when it comes to using modules:

- **Avoiding code repetition**

- **Grouping related behavior**, enabling easier access in the future

- Enables **storing** an application's codebase **across multiple files**, making code **easier to read** and understand
  
- **Their scope** is easier to control and maintain because **modules do not populate the global** scope
  
- **Errors are easier to track down** because they are **isolated to a smaller portion of the program**

## Approaches for Modules

There are **three main ways** to create **modules** in your program:

- Using **immediately invoked function expressions**\(IIFE\)

- Using **Node.js** `require` and `export`

- Using the `import`/`export` statements
  
    * built **directly into JavaScript**

    * before the introduction of **ES6** in 2015, modules were not native to JavaScript
