# Unit Testing Approaches

When we are creating complex software, one of the things we should consider is the **software development approach** to choose.

Two of these development approaches are: 

- The Code-First Approach (write code then test code)
- Test-First Approach (Test-Driven Development)

Both of these approaches are good, but they are suitable for different use cases.

So far, we have always used the **Code-Driven Approach** - we always wrote the code first, and then we wrote our tests.

What fails us, in this case, is ourselves.

When we write tests for a code that we wrote, we may unconsciously write them so they pass, ignoring some edge cases which may break our code. 

That is where the **Test-Driven Approach** comes in place.

# Code and Test Approach

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-OOP-Advanced/08-Test-Driven-Development/EN/Java-OOP-Advanced-Test-Driven-Development-5-The-code-and-test-approach-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

With the code and test approach, we have **three** main steps:

1. Write an implementation of the functionalities we need

2. Write unit tests for these functionalities that cover all the cases

3. Run and either succeed or find bugs in the code

# Test-Driven Development Approach

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-OOP-Advanced/08-Test-Driven-Development/EN/Java-OOP-Advanced-Test-Driven-Development-6-the-test-driven-development-approach-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

There are **test cases** developed to specify and validate what the code will do.

Their purpose is to test our functionalities - if the tests fail, we need to write new code with the necessary bugfixes.

The test-driven development method allows us to develop tests for every small functionality.

We can consider it as a process that relies on the repetition of a development cycle.

Test-driven development is used to develop tests before an actual code implementation.

# Test-Driven Development - Steps

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-OOP-Advanced/08-Test-Driven-Development/EN/Java-OOP-Advanced-Test-Driven-Development-7-test-driven-development-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Let us take a look at the sequence of steps we must follow:

- Create a test list needed to ensure our program is running correctly

- Pick a test

- Write the test for the functionality that should be implemented

- Write just enough code so the program will compile (there is no implementation, so the test will not pass)

- Write a small chunk of code to fit the test (by writing the failing test, we ensure that our test is calling the correct code)

- Run all tests (the test will pass now)

- Refactor

- Repeat the process

# Why TDD

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-OOP-Advanced/08-Test-Driven-Development/EN/Java-OOP-Advanced-Test-Driven-Development-8-Why-TDD-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Let us see some of the advantages of using **TDD**:

- Test-driven development encourages us to develop simple, clean, and meaningful code

- Developers have more time for designing the boundary cases that must be covered by these tests, compared to the traditional approach

- TDD has higher test coverage of the code due to higher test density
