## In this lesson you learned:

- The **SOLID** principles make our software:

    - **understandable**

    - **flexible**

    - **maintainable**

- **Single Responsibility** - one unit must do only one job
 
- **Open-Closed** - code should be open to extensions but closed to changes

- **Liskov Substitution** - functions that reference base classes must be able to use objects of derived (child) classes without knowing it

- **Interface Segregation** - a client should not be forced to implement an interface that is not used

- **Dependency Inversion** - depend on abstractions, not on concretions


## In the next lesson, you will learn:
- Reflection
    - what Java reflection is
    - when and where to use it
- Reflection API
