- **Open/Close** - The code should be open to extensions but closed to changes

- **Liskov Substitution** - Functions that reference base classes must be able to use objects of derived (child) classes without knowing it

- **Interface Segragation** - A client should not be forced to implement an interface that is not used

- **Depndency Inversion** - Depend on abstractions, not on concretions
