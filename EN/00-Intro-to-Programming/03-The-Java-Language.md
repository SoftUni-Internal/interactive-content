# Programming Languages
A programming language is an artificial language (syntax for expression), meant for giving commands that we want the computer to **read**, **process** and **execute**.

Using programming languages, we write **sequences of commands** (programs), which define what the computer should do. 

Examples of programming languages are C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, PHP, Swift, Go and many others. 

These languages differ in their philosophy, syntax, purpose, programming constructions and execution environment. 

The execution of computer programs can be done with a **compiler** or with an **interpreter**.

# Compilers
The **compiler** translates the code from programming language to **machine code**, as for each of the constructions (commands) in the code it chooses a proper, previously prepared fragment of machine code and in the meantime it **checks** the text of the program for **errors**. 

Together, the compiled fragments comprise the program into a machine code, as the microprocessor of the computer expects it.

# Interpreters
The **interpreter** is "a **program for executing programs**", written in some programming language. 

It executes the commands in the program **one after another**, as it understands not only a single command and sequences of commands, but also other language constructions.

# The Java Language
**Java** is modern, general purpose programming language.

Extremely versatile. You can create everything: from Web and mobile apps to games, back-end functionality.

The demand for Java developers is currently among the highest. This ensures professional realization once you have the skills you need! Java is used by about **7,1 million** programmers around the world (according to SlashData). 

Right now Java is one of the most suitable programming languages for **beginners**. 
* It is easy to learn Java through the rich set of video tutorials and exercises at **SoftUni**. 

Combines **procedural**, **object-oriented** and **functional programming** with a **clear and concise syntax**.

# Java Compilation and Execution
As we have already mentioned, a program is **a sequence of commands**, otherwise said, it describes a sequence of calculations, evaluations, iterations and all kinds of similar operations, which aim to obtain certain result.

A Java program is written in a text format, and the text of the program is called a **source code**. 

It gets compiled into an **executable file** or it is **executed directly** from the runtime environment (JRE).

The process of **compilation** of the code before its execution is used only in compiled languages like C#, Java and C++. 

With **scripts and interpreted languages**, like JavaScript, Python and PHP, the source code gets executed step by step by an interpreter.

# JDK and JRE
JDK – Java Development Toolkit

* Java software development kit (Java SDK) – toolset for developers
* Includes a **virtual machine** (JVM), a **Java compiler** (javac) and other developer tools
* JDK is available for free download from Oracle: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/

JDK should not be confused for a runtime environment (JRE)

* JRE allow to **run** Java programs, but can't **develop own programs**
