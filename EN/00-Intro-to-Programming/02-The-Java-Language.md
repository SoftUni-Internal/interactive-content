A programming language is an artificial language designed to instruct a computer to **read**, **process** and **execute** commands.

Programming languages differ in their syntax, purpose, programming constructions, execution environment and much more.

The execution of computer programs can be done using a **compiler** or an **interpreter**.

## Compilers
The **compiler** translates code from a programming language to **machine code** and replaces each of the constructions (commands) with predefined fragments of machine code, in the process it also **checks** the code for **errors**. 

This process makes the code executable by a **microprocessor**.

## Interpreters
The **interpreter** is "**a program which executes programs**". 

The interpreter itself is also written in a programming language. 

It executes the commands in the program code **one after another**, not only can it process a single command or sequence of commands but it can cope with much more complicated constructions.

# The Java Language

**Java** is a modern, general-purpose programming language.

It is versatile and can be used to create many types of programs: from Web and mobile apps to games and back-end functionality.

The demand for Java developers is currently among the highest. 

This greatly increases the chances of professional realization for those who acquire the necessary skills. 

Java is used by more than **7,1 million** programmers around the world (according to the website SlashData.co). 

Java is also one of the most suitable programming languages for **beginners**. 

* It is easy to learn Java through the rich set of video tutorials and exercises at **SoftUni**

It combines **procedural**, **object-oriented** and **functional programming** with a **clear and concise syntax**.

# Java Compilation and Execution

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Programming-Basics/00-intro-programming/EN/Java-basics-introduction-to-programming-13-Java-compilation-and-execution-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

As we have already mentioned a program is a sequence of calculations, evaluations, iterations, and other similar operations, which aim to obtain a certain result.

A Java program is created in a text format, and the text of the program is called **source code**. 

It can get compiled into an **executable file** or **executed directly** by the runtime environment (JRE).

The process of **code compilation** before its execution is used only in **compiled** languages like C#, Java, and C++. 

When using **scripts and interpreted languages**, like JavaScript, Python, and PHP, the source code gets executed step by step by an interpreter.

# JDK and JRE

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Programming-Basics/00-intro-programming/EN/Java-basics-introduction-to-programming-14-15-JDK-JRE-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

## JDK â€“ Java Development Toolkit

* The Java SDK (Software Development Kit)  is a toolset for developers
* It includes a **Virtual Machine** (JVM), a **Java Compiler** (javac) and other developer tools
* JDK is available for free download from Oracle at the following [link](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/)

JDK should not be confused with the java runtime environment (JRE)

* JRE allows us to **run** Java programs, but does not provide the necessary functions to **develop programs**
