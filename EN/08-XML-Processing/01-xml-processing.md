**XML** stands for e**X**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage.

XML is used for storing and transferring information in a structured way.

XML is similar to HTML in the sense that both languages use opening and closing tags to structure the content.

However, XML is **extensible** and you create your own tags that specified how the content is structured as well as the rules on how the document is to be stored and transferred. 

XML does not have a predefined markup language and allows you to create your own markup to describe your content as you see fit.

While HTML is focused on presenting content, XML is used for storing and transferring data.

XML is **language-independent**. It does not matter if you are using it with Java, JavaScript, C#, or any other language.

The primary use for XML is **transmitting data** between web applications and servers.

XML is also used to define the document structure in Microsoft Office products such as Word and Excel, and in fact, the "x" in **.docx** and **.pptx** stands for XML.

There is also a lot of software that uses XML as a format for storing configuration files.

## XML Markup and Content

XML documents contain markup tags placed between **< >** brackets and content between the markup tags.

Here is a sample XML document:

[image assetsSrc="xml-processing-02.png" /]

In this example:
- the `<vehicle>` tag is the markup tag for the `Vehicle` object
- the tags in between the opening and closing **vehicle** tags are properties of the object
    - `<model>` is a property of `<vehicle>` and the content or value of the model property is **X6**

```java
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
```

The above is called a **prolog**.

It defines the XML version and character encoding.

This line is optional but if it exists it must be the first line of the document.

# XML Structure

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-ORM-and-Spring-Data/08.XML-Processing/08.XML-Processing-05-xml-structure-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

When creating XML documents, you can write your **own elements**.

By giving them descriptive names, they become **self-describing**, meaning that it is easy to understand their meaning without having any prior knowledge of what they are.

For instance, if somebody reads through an XML, they would not have to guess what goes into the `<brandName></brandName>` tags.

XML documents can be most naturally expressed as **element trees**.

The XML tree begins with a **root element** and you can have many **sub-elements** that branch off of the root element or off of each other.

Every single element of an XML document can have its own child element(s).

The following example demonstrates a simple tree structure:

```js
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Animal>
    <Cat>
        <Name>Barney</Name>
        <Age>5</Age>
        <Breed>British Shorthair</Breed>
        <Color>Blue</Color>
    </Cat>
</Animal>
```

Let us examine the XML tree in detail:
- `Animal` is the **root element**
- `Cat` is a **child element** of the root element
- `Cat` also has its own child elements branching off of it such as `Name` and `Color`

The tree structure can be represented like this:

If you want to store more than one value in the XML file, you can add a wrapper around the objects, essentially creating a collection of objects:

```js
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Animal>
    <Cats>
        <Cat>
            <Name>Barney</Name>
            <Age>5</Age>
            <Breed>British Shorthair</Breed>
            <Color>Blue</Color>
        </Cat>
        <Cat>
            <Name>Jerry</Name>
            <Age>3</Age>
            <Breed>Tomcat</Breed>
            <Color>Black</Color>
        </Cat>
    </Cats>
</Animal>
```

In the above example, `<Cats></Cats>` is a wrapper around the group of objects.

## Advantages

- XML is extendable
- Simple to understand
- Language-independent
- Platform-independent, can work in any system
- Unicode support

## Disadvantages

- All the opening and closing tags increase the amount of information that is transferred
- More difficult to understand than similar languages such as JSON
- XML does not support arrays
