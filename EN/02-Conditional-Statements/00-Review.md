# Variables
In programming **data** is stored in **variables**

  * Variables store data in a piece of the memory
  * Variable read: retrieve the stored data
  * Variable write: modify the stored information
  
Declaring, initializing, reading and changing a variable in JS:
```js live
let age = 5;
age = age + 1;
console.log(age);
```
# Data Types in JS
* Number (e.g. 0.5, 0, 120, -250)

* Boolean (true / false)

* Symbols (e.g. 'X', '#', '\n')

* Strings (e.g. "Hello JS", 'Hi')

# Expressions and Statements
**Expressions** == **variables** and **values**, combined with **operators**

```js
a = b * 2;
// 2 is a literal value expression
// a = b * 2 is an assignment expression
// b is a variable expression
// b * 2 is an arithmetic expression
```

Statements - Commands / actions to be executed

```js
a = b * 2;
// Get the current value stored in b
// Multiply that value by 2
// Store the result back into another variable we call a
```
