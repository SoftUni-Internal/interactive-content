The next type of loops that we will get familiar with is the so-called **while-loops**. 

**While-loops** execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is **true**.

Structurally, they differ from the **for-loops** and their syntax is simpler.

Let us see a real life example.

You need to fill a bucket with water using a glass.

You do not know how many glasses of water are required.

You will stop when the bucket is full.

In this example, you work until reaching a certain condition.
