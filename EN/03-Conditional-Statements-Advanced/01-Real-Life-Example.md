A market offers different prices for certain products based on the day of the week


| **Product**      | **Weekday** | **Weekend**   |
| :---:       |    :----:   |   :---:     |
| Banana      | 2.50       | 2.70 |
| Apple   | 1.30        | 1.60    |
| Kiwi   | 2.20        | 3.00    |

We want to calculate the price for a certain product, depending on the day of the week:

## Pseudocode

```
Read the input
If the product is banana
  If it is a weekday the price is 2.50
  Otherwise, the price is 2.70
If the product is apple
  If its a weekday the price is 1.30
  Otherwise, the price is 1.60
If the product is a kiwi
  If its a weekday the price is 2.20
  Otherwise, the price is 3.00
```
