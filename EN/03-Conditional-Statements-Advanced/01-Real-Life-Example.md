A market offers different prices for their products based on the day of the week.

[image assetsSrc="03-conditional-statements-advanced-example.png" /]

|**Product**|**Weekday**|**Weekend**| 
|---|---|---|
|Banana|2.50|2.70|
|Apple|1.30|1.60|
|Kiwi|2.20|3.00|

We need to crete a program to help us determine the price of each product according to the day.

## Pseudocode

```
Read the input 
If the product is a banana
  If it is a weekday the price is 2.50
  Otherwise, the price is 2.70
If the product is an apple
  If it is a weekday the price is 1.30
  Otherwise, the price is 1.60
If the product is a kiwi
  If it is a weekday the price is 2.20
  Otherwise, the price is 3.00
```
