# The "switch-case" Statement

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/javascript-basics/03.Conditions-Advanced/02-conditional-statements-advanced-js-30-31-Multiple-Labels-New-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

The switch-case condition works as a sequence of if-else blocks. 

Whenever the work of our program depends on the value of one variable, instead of making consecutive conditions with `if-else` blocks, we can **use** the conditional "**switch**" statement. 

It is being used for **choosing between a list of possibilities**. 

The statement compares a given value with defined constants and depending on the result, it takes an action.

- We put **the variable** that we want to **compare**, inside the **brackets after the operator** "**switch**" and it is called a **"selector"**
- The type must be **comparable** (numbers, strings, etc) 
- **Consecutively**, the program starts comparing each value which is found after the case labels 
- Upon a match, the execution of the code from the respective place begins and continues until it reaches the operator `break`

`break` might be skipped, to execute a code from another `case` construction, until it reaches another operator. 

When **no matches** are **found**, the `default` construction is being executed, **if** such **exists**.

```js
switch (selector) {
  case value1:
    statements;
    break;
  case value2:
    statements;
    break;
}
```

# The Default Case

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/javascript-basics/03.Conditions-Advanced/02-conditional-statements-advanced-js-29-switch-case-example-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

The default case specifies the "**switch**" section to execute **if the match expression doesn't match any other case label**.

If a default case is not present and the match expression doesn't match any other case label, program flow **falls** through the switch statement.

The default case can appear in any order in the switch statement, but regardless of its order in the source code, it is always evaluated **last**, after all, case labels have been evaluated.

```js
switch (selector) {
  case value1:
    statements;
    break;
  case value2:
    statements;
    break;
  default:
    statements;
    break;
}
```

## Example: Day of the Week
Let us write a program that prints **the day of the week** (in English) depending on the **given number** (1 â€¦ 7) or "**Error!**" if invalid input is given.

```js
let day = Number(input);
switch (day) {
    case 1:
      console.log('Monday');
      break;
    case 2:
      console.log('Tuesday');
      break;
    case 3:
      console.log('Wednesday');
      break;
    case 4:
      console.log('Thursday');
      break;
    case 5:
      console.log('Friday');
      break;
    case 6:
      console.log('Saturday');
      break;
    case 7:
      console.log('Sunday');
      break;
    default:
      console.log('Error!');
      break;
}
```

# Multiple Labels

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/javascript-basics/03.Conditions-Advanced/02-conditional-statements-advanced-js-30-31-Multiple-Labels-New-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

In **JS** we can use **multiple** `case` labels in the "**switch-case**" coonstruction, when they have to execute **the same code**. 

This way, when our **program** finds a **match**, it will execute the **next** code, because **after** the respective `case` label **there is no code** for execution and a `break` operator. 

```js
switch (selector) {
    case value1:
    case value2:
    case value3:
        construction;
        break;
    case value4:
    case value5:
        construction;
        break;
    default:
        construction;
        break;
}
```

# Example: Animal Type

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/javascript-basics/03.Conditions-Advanced/02-conditional-statements-advanced-js-32-Multiple-Labels-Example-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Write a program that prints the type of animal depending on its name:
-  Sog \-\> **mammal**
-  Crocodile, tortoise, snake \-\> **reptile**
-  Others \-\> **unknown**

We can solve the task with "**switch-case**" conditions with multiple labels in the following way:
```js live
let animal = 'snake';
switch (animal) {
    case 'dog':
    case 'cat':
      console.log('mammal');
      break;
    case 'crocodile':
    case 'tortoise':
    case 'snake':
      console.log('reptile');
      break;
    default:
      console.log('unknown');
      break;
}
```
