# Problem: Copy a Picture

Create a program that makes a copy of a **.jpg** file using **FileInputStream**, **FileOutputStream**, and `byte[]` buffer. 

Set the name of the new file as **picture-copy.jpg**.

To start, pick a random image.

Then, create a new project and open the **Main** class.

In the `Main.java` file, add the necessary **imports**, if your IDE does not already:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
```

Or just `import java.io.*;`.

Inside the `main` method, create a `try-catch` block:

```java
try {
    // Here, we will initialize the the I/O streams and clone the image. 🧑‍💻
    
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Exception handling logic goes here. 😵
    
}
```

Then, inside the `try` block, create an input stream for the original image.

Initialize a new **input stream** using `new File("the-absolute-path-to-your\\image")`.

You can get the absolute path to your image by right-clicking on it, and choosing "**Properties**".

After that, create an **output stream** with the "**picture-copy.jpg**" string as a parameter.

Create a `byte[]` buffer with a size **bigger than or equal to** your image size, in bytes.

Use a while loop to **write the data** to the output stream, as shown below.

```java
try {
    FileInputStream inputImage = new FileInputStream(new File("C:\\Folder1\\picture.jpg"));
    FileOutputStream outputImage = new FileOutputStream("picture-copy.jpg");

    int oneByte;
    byte[] buffer = new byte[8192]; // The size should be >= to that of your image. 🏞
    while ((oneByte = inputImage.read(buffer)) != -1) {
        outputImage.write(buffer, 0, count);
    }

    System.out.println("The image was copied successfully! 😎");
    
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("There was a problem with the file. 😿");
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

The cloned image is now **saved** in your project folder.

# Problem: Serialize Array List

Create a program that saves and loads an **ArrayList** of doubles to a file using **ObjectInputStream** and **ObjectOutputStream**. 

Your IDE must add the following **imports** in the process:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

To start, let us create an ArrayList of **doubles** in the body of `main()`.

```java
ArrayList<Double> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
```

Next, **add** the following floating-point **numbers**:

```java
numbers.add(46.2);
numbers.add(32.5);
numbers.add(11.7);
```

To catch possible **errors** with the I/O operations, create a `try-catch` block.

```java
try {
    FileOutputStream writeData = new FileOutputStream("list.ser");
    ObjectOutputStream writeStream = new ObjectOutputStream(writeData);

    writeStream.writeObject(numbers);
    writeStream.flush();
    writeStream.close();
    
    System.out.println("The ArrayList was serialized successfully! 😎");

} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred. 😿");
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

Create a `FileOutputStream` called **WriteData** and set the name of the file as **list.ser**.

By providing only the **name**, without a path, the file will be saved in the project's main directory.

`ObjectOutputStream` will handle writing the object into the file that `FileOutputStream` created.

Calling thе `writeObject(numbers)` method tells the program to start writing into **list.ser**.

A good practice is to use `.flush()` - it flushes the output stream and forces any buffered output bytes to be written out.

Opening the **list.ser** file, you will see the following **output**:

```
���sr�java.util.ArrayListx����a��I�sizexp���w���sr�java.lang.Double���J)k��D�valuexr�java.lang.Number��������xp@G�����sq�~�@@@�����sq�~�@'ffffffx
```

Do not worry if it does not make sense to you, Java can read it just fine.

Using this file, you can **deserialize** the ArrayList.

Clear out the `main()` method, and write:

```java
try {
    FileInputStream readData = new FileInputStream("list.ser");
    ObjectInputStream readStream = new ObjectInputStream(readData);

    ArrayList<Double> peopleDsl = (ArrayList<Double>) readStream.readObject();
    readStream.close();
    
    System.out.println(peopleDsl.toString());
    
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred. 😿");
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

You can now see the ArrayList's data, printed on the **console**:

```
[46.2, 32.5, 11.7]
```

# Problem: Serialize Custom Object

Create a program that saves and loads information about a custom object using **ObjectInputStream** and **ObjectOutputStream**.

Create a **simple class** called "**Course**" that has the following values upon initialization:

- **name** - String
    * the name of the course
- **studentsCount** - int
    * contains the **number of students** attending the course

The class **must implement** the `Serializable` interface.

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Course implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int studentsCount;

    public Course(String name, int studentsCount) {
        this.name = name;
        this.studentsCount = studentsCount;
    }


    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }


    public int getStudentsCount() {
        return this.studentsCount;
    }

    public void setStudentsCount(int studentsCount) {
        this.studentsCount = studentsCount;
    }


    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return new StringBuffer("Course name: ")
                .append(this.name)
                .append(", Students enrolled: ")
                .append(this.studentsCount)
                .toString();
    }

}
```

Once you are done creating the class, make a new instance of it, inside `main()`:

```java
Course course = new Course("Programming with Python",  32);
```

Create a `try-catch` block:

```java
try {
    FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("course.ser");
    ObjectOutputStream objectOut = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut);
    objectOut.writeObject(course);
    objectOut.close();

    System.out.println("The object was succesfully written to a file! ☑️");

} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred. 😵");
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

Inside of `try`, set the name of the saved file as **course.ser**.

Then, create an `ObjectOutputStream` instance in order to write the `course` object to the file.

**Close** the output stream and create a `catch` block for **error handling**. 

Inside of it, print the **stack trace**.

Assuming no errors occurred, the file is now saved in your project's directory:

```
�� sr com.company.Course�`��/�u I 
studentsCountL namet Ljava/lang/String;xp    t Programming with Python
```

To **deserialize** the object, use the following code:

```java
Course courseDsl;

try {
    FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream("course.ser");
    ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fileIn);

    courseDsl = (Course) in.readObject();

    in.close();
    fileIn.close();

    System.out.println(courseDsl.toString());

} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("An exception occurred. 😾");
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

Declare a new object of type `Course`, named **CourseDsl**.

Create a `FileInputStream` to read **course.ser**.

Then, create an `ObjectInputStream` instance.

Use the `readObject()` method to **deserialize** the object.

After **closing** the input streams, use the `courseDsl.toString()` method to **print** information:

```
Course name: Programming with Python, Students enrolled: 32
```

# Problem: Create Zip Archive

Create a program that reads three **.txt** files and creates a `zip` archive named **files.zip**. 

Use **FileOutputStream**, **ZipOutputStream**, and **FileInputStream**.

To start, create three **.txt** files in a new folder.


You will need the following imports:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.util.zip.*;
```
