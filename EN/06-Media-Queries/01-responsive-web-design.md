Responsive Web Design is all about using HTML and CSS to **automatically resize**, **hide**, **shrink**, or **enlarge**, a website, to make it look appealing on **all devices** (desktops, tablets, and phones).

## What is The Viewport?

The viewport is the area of a web page which is visible for the user.

The viewport varies on different devices and it is smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

### Setting The Viewport

Through the <meta> tag in HTML we can take control over the viewport.

To use it, we should include the following `<meta>` **viewport** element in all our web pages:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

This will give the browser instructions on how to control the page’s **dimensions** and **scaling**.

`width=device-width` - sets the width of the page to follow the **screen-width** of the **device**.

`initial-scale=1.0` - sets the **initial zoom** level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
