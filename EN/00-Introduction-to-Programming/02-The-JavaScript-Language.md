# Programming Languages

A programming language is an artificial language (syntax for expression), meant for giving commands that we want the computer to **read**, **process** and **execute**.

Using programming languages, we write **sequences of commands** (programs), which define what the computer should do. 

Examples of programming languages are C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, PHP, Swift, Go and many others. 

These languages differ in their philosophy, syntax, purpose, programming constructions and execution environment. 

The execution of computer programs can be done with a **compiler** or with an **interpreter**.

# Compilers

The **compiler** translates the code from programming language to **machine code**, as for each of the constructions (commands) in the code it chooses a proper, previously prepared fragment of machine code and in the meantime it **checks** the text of the program for **errors**.

Together, the compiled fragments comprise the program into a machine code, as the microprocessor of the computer expects it.

# Interpreters

The **interpreter** is "a **program for executing programs**", written in some programming language. 

It executes the commands in the program **one after another**, as it understands not only a single command and sequences of commands, but also other language constructions.

# The JavaScript Language

**JavaScript** is prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language. 

It is used both on the client-side (in the Web browser) and on the server-side (in Node.js).

The demand for JavaScript developers is currently among the highest. This ensures professional realization once you have the skills you need! JS is used by about **10,7 million** programmers around the world (according to SlashData). 

Right now JS is one of the most suitable programming languages for **beginners**.
* It is easy to learn JS through the rich set of video tutorials and exercises at **SoftUni**.

Supports **imperative**, **functional** and **object-oriented** programming with a **clear and concise syntax**.

# JavaScript Execution

As we have already mentioned, a program is **a sequence of commands**, otherwise said, it describes a sequence of calculations, evaluations, iterations and all kinds of similar operations, which aim to obtain certain result.

A JS program is written in a text format, and the text of the program is called a **source code**. 

The interpreter executes the code directly line by line.

With **scripts and interpreted languages**, like JavaScript, Python and PHP, the source code gets executed step by step by an interpreter.

The process of **compilation** of the code before its execution is used only in compiled languages like C#, Java and C++.
