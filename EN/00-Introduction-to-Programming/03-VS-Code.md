In order to program we need an **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE). 

An **Integrated Development Environment** (or IDE) is a combination of some traditional tools for creating software applications.

In the development environment we can **write code**, **compile**, and e**xecute programs**. 

Development environments usually integrate a **text editor**, a **programming language**, a **compiler** or an **interpreter** and a runtime environment for **executing programs**.

They also may contain a **debugger** for tracking the program and seeking out errors, and tools for **user interface design** or other utilities and add-ons. 

Development environments are convenient, because they integrate **everything necessary for the development** of a program, in some cases even without the need for external tools.

If we don't use an IDE, we would have to write the code in a **text editor**, compile it with a command on the console, run it with another console command and eventually include additional commands whenever needed, which is very time consuming. 

For programming with **JavaScript**, the most commonly used IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), which is developed and distributed freely by Microsoft.

Some of the **popular** alternatives to Visual Studio Code are: 

- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

In this course, we are going to use **Visual Studio Code.** 

This is an example of how this IDE looks (the Visual Studio Code IDE for JavaScript):

# Installing Node.js and Visual Studio Code

We need **Node.js** so that we can execute JavaScript code outside of a browser.

* server-side JS runtime.

[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-3.png" /]

You can download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-nodejs-1.png" /]

Select your OS and go on with installing.

Let's continue with the installation of the integrated environment **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**.

Installing later versions of Visual Studio Code should be very similar.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (VS Code) is distributed freely by Microsoft.

The installation is typical for Windows with `[Next]`, `[Next]` and `[Finish]`.

The next lines describe in detail the steps for the installation of Visual Studio Code. 

After we download the installation file and start it, the following screen appears:
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-1.png" /]

Press the `[Next]` button and you will see the screen bellow:
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-2.png" /]

You can choose a destination location or leave the default one. Then press the `[Next]` button again.

Now we have to specify a name for the program folder which will be created in the Start Menu. 

The next step is to put check marks on the these tasks:

VS is now ready for installation. Press the `[Install]` button. Basically this is everything.
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-5.png" /]

Installation of Visual Studio begins, and a screen like the one bellow will appear:
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-6.png" /]

After Visual Studio is installed, an informative screen will appear. Press the `[Launch]` button to start it.
[image assetsSrc="intro-to-programming-install-vscode-7.png" /]

Upon **starting VS Code** the main view of Visual Studio Code is displayed.

That's all. You are ready to work with Visual Studio Code.

Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 
* You can use an older version, but it is not recommended

Alternative IDE (online)

* JavaScript: directly use the browser console (press \[F12\] key)
* [C#](https://dotnetfiddle.net)
* [Java](https://compilejava.net)
* [Python](https://repl.it)
