# Skills of the Software Engineers

[image assetsSrc="personal-skills.png" /]

There are 4 main groups of skills, that any skillful programmer has and to which every beginner must strive:

**Coding skills**, which forms 20% of the developer skills.

- Coding is an essential skill, which once learned, can be applied in many programming languages.

**Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving**, which forms 30% of the developer skills.
 
- Algorithmic thinking is a way of getting to a solution through a clear definition of the steps needed.

- It includes the ability to break a problem into a logical sequence of steps (called "algorithm"), to find a solution for every separate step (or break it further into sub-steps), and then assemble these steps into a working solution.

**Computer science** and software engineering concepts, which forms 25% of the developer skills.

- The fundamental computer science and software development concepts include many programming paradigms.

- Essential software development knowledge and skills.

- Software engineering principles and concepts that developers typically acquire as they gain experience over time.

**Languages and software technologies**, which forms 25% of the developer skills.

- Technologies consist of a large amount of technical knowledge, which change very fast.

- Once you learn a software technology, it could be outdated in a few years or even months and new versions or entirely new technologies will come as a replacement.

- Technology is changing fast but the coding skills, algorithmic thinking, and software development concepts and principles are staying for the long run.

- The usual lifetime of modern software technologies is 2-3 years.

Software technologies are highly dependent on the previous 75% of the developer skills, which are:

- Strong coding skills.

- Algorithmic thinking and technical problem-solving.

- Computer science and development concepts.

To be a software developer, you need to have all these 4 groups of essential developer skills.

In addition to the tech skills, developers should have also soft skills, such as:

- Verbal and written communication skills.

- Teamwork skills – the skill to work successfully with other people.

- Organizational skills, time management, planning, and prioritization.

# Algorithmic Thinking 

[image assetsSrc="algorum-thinking.png" /]

For software developers **algorithmic thinking** and **problem-solving** skills are essential and we shall explain them in deeper detail.

**Algorithmic**, or engineering, or mathematical thinking is the **ability to analyze problems** and find solutions through a clear definition of the steps needed.

Algorithmic thinking is the **skill to break-down** a technical problem into steps.

And those steps make up an algorithm which can be **break-down into sub-steps** when necessary.

And assemble the solution from the result of the steps performed in the specified sequence.

**Algorithmic thinking** is formed slowly and consistently through a lot of learning, reading about algorithms and data structures, and a large amount of problem-solving practice.

Programming languages **do not matter** for building algorithmic thinking.

At the same time, you can code in the oldest programming language, but with **algorithmic thinking**, your code will be correct, clean, fast, and elegant.

It is better to spend more time **solving** algorithmic problems than to be a bad performer or untidy developer later.
