# Read and Analyze the Problems

[image assetsSrc="exam-pic.png" /]

At your Programming Fundamentals practical exam you'll have **3 problems** to solve in **4 hours**.

First, **read all the problems carefully** and try to estimate how **complex each** one of them is from your perspective of course.

Read the **requirements**, don't invent them!

Start solving the **easiest** and **fastest** to solve the problem first.

**Leave** the most complex and slow to solve problem **last**.

Approach the next problem when the previous is well tested.

# Use a Sheet of Paper and a Pen

Never start solving a problem without a **sheet of paper and a pen**.

You need to sketch your ideas, paper and pen is the best **visualization tool**.

It allows your brain to **think visually**. Paper works faster than the keyboard and screen.

Squared paper works best for algorithmic problems its:
- Easy to draw a table
- Easy to draw a coordinate system with objects in it
- Easy to calculate distances
- Easy to sketch a problem and solution ideas

# Managing Your Time

At the exam you have **limited time!**

Start with the problem, which will take you the **least time**.

Then, again the problem, which will take you the **least time**.

When you **achieve a result** of 80\/100 or 90\/100, think carefully for the edge cases and try to handle them.

After you spend 10-15 minutes on the last few tests, **stop!**

**Don't spend hours** for the last 10% of the tests!

Achieving a score of 80-90% of 3 problems is better than 100% of just 1 problem.

# Typical Mistakes at the Exam

1. Wrong approach: **start coding** in the first 5 minutes.
    - These students have not read the problems and they are more likely to fail.
    - They don't start with the easiest problem, but with the first one.

2. Wrong approach: **don't use** pen and paper.
    - These students try to invent solutions in their minds.
    - Instead of visualizing their ideas on a sheet of paper.
3. Wrong approach: debugging in **your mind**.
    - Try to find the bugs by reading the code
    - This is wrong: you have a debugger in your IDE!

4. Wrong approach: **spend all the time** at the first problem.
    - Some students spend 4 hours at the first problem they approach.
    - This is wrong: when you spend 1 hour at a certain problem, without significant progress go to the next problem!
    - You can go back to the first problem, after you solve the others.

5. Wrong approach: try to **achieve** 100% for hours.
    - Some students spend hours moving from 90% to 100% for the first problem and never start the next problem.
    - Approach the next problem 10-15 minutes after you reach 70%-90% of the score!

5. Wrong approach: don't take a **short break**, when you block.
    - Everyone can block, get angry, get nervous, or can't concentrate.
    - Take a short break, go outside, breathe, calm down.

7. Wrong approach: come to the exam **unprepared**.
    - Prepare yourself, study hard, practice a lot, solve sample exams.
    - You are ready when you can solve any previous exam for 1-2 hours.

8. Wrong approach: **trying to cheat**
    - Many students try to cheat (e.g. use help from friends).
    - Cheating is bad for you! Who will do your future job?
