# Solving a Problem
[image assetsSrc="ps-stages.png" /]

To solve a problem you need a **logical** or **algorithmic** thinking.

After that you go through these steps:

- **Define** the problem.

- **Analyse** the problem.

- **Identify** potential solutions.

- **Evaluate** and choose a solution.

- **Plan** actions.

- **Implement** the algorithm.

- **Review** the results of testing.

# Real-World Problem: Street Crossing

In this problem, you're going to use all the steps mentioned above to solve it.

1. Define the problem:
   - Your goal is to go on the other side of the street without the risk of incidents.

2. Analyze the problem:
   - avoid the vehicles,
   - find a walkway or traffic light or safe place to cross.

3. Identify potential solutions:
   - use the walkway,
   - use the traffic light,
   - use other safe places to cross.

4. Evaluate and choose a solution:
   - no walkway,
   - traffic light too far,
   - but we have a safe place to cross.

5. Plan actions (algorithm):
    - get to the safe place,
    - look left and right and cross when no vehicles are around.

6. Implement:
    - execute the plan (or write the code in programming).

7. Review the results:
    - are we happy of the result,
    - can we do it better,
    - does it work for all the cases?

You can use these seven simple steps to solve almost any problem.
