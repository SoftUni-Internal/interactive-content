# What Are Design Patterns

In software engineering, design patterns represent **general** and **reusable solutions** to common flaws in application design.

It is important to understand that design patterns by themselves **are not** finished and ready for implementation **templates**.

Instead, they are **general descriptions** of problem-solving **templates** that can be applied in many situations.

## Why Do We Use Design Patterns

By applying design patterns, we can solve structural problems and speed up the development process by implementing **well-proven development paradigms**.

Also, we can prevent future issues.

In the process, we also improve code readability.

The most common **problems** that design patterns solve concern:

- Abstraction

- Encapsulation

- Separation of concerns 

- Coupling and cohesion

- Separation of interface and implementation

- Divide and conquer

Design patterns consist of **four** elements:

- Pattern name 

- Problem - its intent, context and when to apply

- Solution - abstract code, or a template of an idea to solve our problems

- Consequences - **results** and tradeoffs

# Why Design Patterns

## Benefits

Let us start with the benefits design patterns deliver.

Design patterns bring standardization to your projects. 

They also ensure that your code follows programming principles like **coupling** and **cohesion**.

We learned the basics of **coupling** and **cohesion** in previous lessons.

Today, we will expand our knowledge a bit.

We can say that **coupled components interact with each other**. 

That is how they pass information to each other. 

High coupling usually leads to complex code.

We cannot completely dismiss the need for components to interact with each other.

Usually, low coupling indicates a **good code structure**.

There are many types of coupling but we will not explore each one.

Design patterns can make codig easier. 

They can help us analyze the more abstract ideas of our program by **providing well-tested solutions**.

It is important to understand that design patterns teach us to write **faster** and **clearer** code. 

This provides us with a clear picture of how to implement a software design.

## Drawbacks

Unfortunately, design patterns **do not lead** to direct code reuse.

Sometimes we tend to **overload** and **redesign** our patterns.

Design patterns should only be followed if the developer has good knowledge about them.

They may often be used improperly and with little thought about code flexibility.

# Types of Design Patterns

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-OOP-Advanced/09-Design-Pattern/EN/Java-OOP-Advanced-Design-Patterns-10-11-types-of-design-patterns-main-types-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

The rest of the lesson covers the main types of design patterns as well as their practical implementation.

They can be divided into three categories:

- **Creational patterns**
  - handle **initialization** and the **configuration** of objects and classes
- **Structural patterns**
  - responsible for **class composition** and **assembling objects**
- **Behavioral patterns**
  - handle **dynamic interaction** between classes and distribute **responsibilities**

Try to implement each of the following design patterns and make sure you understand them before moving on to the next lesson.
