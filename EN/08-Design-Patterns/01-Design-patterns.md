# What Are Design Patterns

In software engineering, design patterns represent **general** and **reusable solutions** to common flaws in application design.

It is important to understand that design patterns by themselves **are not** finished and ready for implementation **templates**.

Instead, they are **general descriptions** of problem-solving **templates** that can be applied in many situations.

## Why do we use **design patterns**

By applying design patterns, we can solve structural problems and speed up the development process by implementing **well-proven development paradigms**.

Also, we can prevent future issues that can cause serious problems.

In the process, we also improve code readability.

The most common **problems** that design patterns solve are:

- Abstraction

- Encapsulation

- Separation of concerns 

- Coupling and cohesion

- Separation of interface and implementation

- Divide and conquer

Design patterns consist of **four** elements:

- Pattern name - concise and descriptive

- Problem - intent, context, and when to apply

- Solution - abstract code, or a template of an idea to solve our problems

- Consequences - **results** and tradeoffs

# Benefits and Drawbacks

## Benefits

Let us start with the benefits design patterns deliver.

Design patterns bring standardization to your projects. 

They also ensure that your code follows programming principles like **coupling** and **cohesion**.

We learned the basics of **coupling** and **cohesion** in previous lessons.

Today, we will try to expand our knowledge a bit.

We can say that **coupled components interact with each other**. 

That is how they pass information to each other. 

High coupling usually leads to complex code.

We cannot completely dismiss the need for components to interact with each other.

Usually, low coupling indicates a **good code structure**.

The coupling has many types, but we will not explore each type.

Design patterns can make our job easier. 

They can help us analyze the more abstract ideas of our program by **providing well-tested solutions**.

It is important to understand that design patterns teach us to write **faster** and **more clear** code. 

That provides us with a clearer picture of how we are implementing the software design.

## Drawbacks

Unfortunately, design patterns **do not lead** to direct code reuse.

Sometimes we tend to **overload** and **overdesign** our patterns.

Design patterns should only be followed if the developer has good knowledge about them.

They are often used improperly, with little thought about code flexibility.
