# Client Server Model

The server in a client-server model is simply the **DBMS**, whereas the client is the database application serviced by the **DBMS**.

We have distributed client-servers when the client is on one computer and the server and database are on another. It is simply referred to as the client-server model.

The connection between the client and the server is done over **TCP/IP** - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.

TCP is responsible for transferring data in small packages and the IP is responsible for sending data from one IP address to another.

Here are some of the default ports used by databases:

- MySQL - 3306
- Microsoft SQL Server - 1433
- Oracle - 1521

MySQL has many clients: HeidiSQL, MySQL Workbench, etc.
