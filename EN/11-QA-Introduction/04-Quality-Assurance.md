# Software Quality Assurance

Software quality assurance (**SQA**), for short QA, this is Quality Assurance. These are the people who care about the quality of the code, in the sense of detecting errors, detecting bugs, so that they are prevented before it is fatal. If you can prevent errors before you provide the customer with the service, this is the best option. The work is performed by the **quality assurance engineers** (usually called **QA engineers**)

Most of the QA work is **software testing**. There are two types of testing:

*  **Manual Testing**
* **Automation Testing**

# The Software QA Process

Initially, QA helps design and **control the development process** in a way that prevents serious issues during the project. To make this happen, QA engineers work on the project together with other team members (**product owner**, **project manager**, **business analyst**, and **dev lead**) throughout the complete software development cycle. The number and the order of QA activities may vary from project to project, depending heavily on the scope of the work and the project aims.

* Analysis of requirements
* Design
* Implementation
* Verification or testing
* Maintenance

## QA Process

* Review of requirements
* Test planning / writing test cases
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* System testing
