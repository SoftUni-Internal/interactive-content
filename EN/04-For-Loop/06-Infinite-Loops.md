# Infinite Loops

Now that we know about the **for-loop** and its structure, 

we will see what an **infinite loop** is and when it occurs.

An **infinite loop** is a loop that **repeats indefinitely**. 

An infinite **for-loop** occurs when **it is set up so that it never meets its exit condition**.

Here is what a **for-loop** with no exit condition might look like:
```java
for ( ; ; ) {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

Usually, it is the result of a programming error - for example, when the exit conditions are incorrectly placed. 

An infinite loop is usually not dangerous but can be troublesome when it occurs.

So we have to be careful not to cause one by accident.
