Let us imagine we are loading a dishwasher

[image assetsSrc="04.For-Loop-Real-Life-Example-Dishes.png" /]

We can see **exactly how many** dishes we are going to move from the sink to the dishwasher

We **will keep going** **until** we have completed the task.

So, we will pick up **one** and put it in the dishwasher.

Then we will pick up the **second one** and put it in the dishwasher and continue **repeating the same action** until we put all the dishes in the dishwasher.

We will repeat this action a **number** of times which **we know beforehand**.
