# HTTP Developer Tools: Network Inspector

[image assetsSrc="Dev-tools.png" /]

Modern Web browsers, such as `Chrome` and `Firefox` have built-in tools for network monitoring and inspecting the **HTTP traffic**.

To show the Chrome Developer Tools, press the `F12` key in **Google Chrome** or right-click on a Web page and click `Inspect` in the context menu.
You will see the **Chrome Dev Tools window,** which has many tabs.

From the `Elements` tab, you can inspect the **UI controls** on the Web page (the so-called DOM tree).

From the `Console` tab you can see the errors and logs for the currently loaded Web page, and you can execute JavaScript commands.

From the `Network` tab you can view and inspect the HTTP traffic between the currently open Web page and the Web servers to which the page communicates.

# HTTP Developer Tools: HTTP Client Tools

[Postman](https://www.postman.com) is a HTTP client tool for developers.

You can use it for composing and sending HTTP requests and analyzing the HTTP response from the server, for testing, debugging server APIs, researching how to use certain service API, and resolving technical issues during the software development.

With [Postman](https://www.postman.com) you can create an **HTTP request**, send it to the Web server, view the HTTP response, and generate a source code to execute the HTTP request in many programming languages.

We encourage you to play around with [Postman](https://www.postman.com) during the exercise and homework sessions.

[Insomnia Core REST Client](https://insomnia.rest) is another client HTTP tool for developers, like Postman

[Postwoman](https://postwoman.io) is a Web-based Postman-like HTTP client tool, running directly from the Web, without installation.
