# Access Modifiers

- Derived classes **can access all public** and **protected** members
- Derived classes can access **default** members **if in the same package**
- **Private** fields cannot be accessed from the **Subclasses** but they are instantiated, as the **Parent** needs them for its internal logic

```java
class Person {
  protected String address;   // Can be accessed from its Subclasses.
  public void sleep();        // Access from everywhere in the project.
  String name;                // Can be accessed through other methods.
  private String id;          // It can be accessed only from the class delegator itself.
}
```

# Shadowing Variables

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-OOP-Advanced/02-Inheritance/EN/Java-OOP-Advanced-Inheritance-22-shadowing-variables-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

- Derived classes **can hide/shadow** Superclass variables by implementing a unit with the same name for itself


- When you are using **shadowing** you can rebase an entire method, this means changing its parameters and logic inside, but not its return type. 

```java
class Person { 
  protected int weight; 
  }

class Patient extends Person {
  protected float weight; //hides (shadows) int weight.
  public void method() {
    double weight = 0.5d; //As it is more concrete, it hides both but it lives only inside the method brackets.
  }
}
```

# Shadowing Variables – Access

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-OOP-Advanced/02-Inheritance/EN/Java-OOP-Advanced-Inheritance-23-shadowing-variables-access-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

- Use **super** and **this** to specify member access

```java
class Person { protected int weight; }

class Patient extends Person {
  protected float weight;
  public void method() {
    double weight = 0.5d; //Local variable
    this.weight = 0.6f; //Instance member
    super.weight = 1; //Base class member
  }
}

# Overriding Derived Methods

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-OOP-Advanced/02-Inheritance/EN/Java-OOP-Advanced-Inheritance-24-overriding-derived-methods-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

**Overriding** is a mechanism in which we can give a custom implementation of a given class method down the hierarchy.

It is done by using the `@Override` keyword.

It is an important tool as it is connected to another pillar of the OOP **Polymorphism**.

The difference between **Shadowing** and **Overriding** is that when you override you cannot change the parameters.

Other than that, when we have a **variable of a base class type** and we hold a **Subclass object** if we have an overridden class member and we call it, it will use **the logic declared by the Subclass overriding it**.

By contrast, if you use **shadowing**, it will always call the **base class implementation**.


```java
public class Person {  
  public void sleep() { 
  System.out.println("Person sleeping"); } // Here we declare a method.
}
```
- A method that we want to override should not be set as `final`

```java
public class Student extends Person {
  @Override                                   // The Attribute @Override means that this method is being given new/extended implementation.
  public void sleep(){
    System.out.println("Student sleeping");   // Between the brackets we declare the new implementation.
  }   
}
```
- Signature and return type **should match**

# Final Methods and Classes

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-OOP-Advanced/02-Inheritance/EN/Java-OOP-Advanced-Inheritance-25-final-methods-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

- `final` – defines a method that **cannot be overridden**
  - we should use this tool when we want to preserve our method implementation down the class hierarchy
  - `final` can be declared in any derived class and it gets in power for the classes children down the hierarchy

```java
public class Animal {
  public final void eat() { … }
}

public class Dog extends Animal { 
  
  @Override
  public void eat() {} // Error…
}
```

- **Inheriting from a final class is forbidden**

```java
public final class Animal {
  …
}

public class Dog extends Animal { }      // Error…
public class MyString extends String { } // Error…
public class MyMath extends Math { }     // Error…
```

# Inheritance Benefits 

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-OOP-Advanced/02-Inheritance/EN/Java-OOP-Advanced-Inheritance-27-inheritance-benefits-abstraction-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

- With inheritance, we can provide an abstraction to the classes we use
- We can re-use code, less code means fewer bugs
- We can achieve **Polymorphism**
- Inheritance provides a clear model structure, which is easy to understand
- With inheritance, if we have a bug in the parent class, we can fix it for all child classes as well

[image assetsSrc="inheritance-example(13).png" /]

```java
Person person = new Person();    // When we have a base class
Student student = new Student(); // And another inherited class 

List<Person> people = new ArrayList(); // We can contain both of them in a collection of the base class

people.add(person);
people.add(student);
```

# Extension

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-OOP-Advanced/02-Inheritance/EN/Java-OOP-Advanced-Inheritance-28-inheritance-benefits-extension-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

- We can extend a class that we can not otherwise change, implementing the custom logic we need

If we take notice of the picture, we see an extension of the `Lists<>` logic, when we derive, although we can not see the original implementation, we can write more methods or parameters to our custom class, therefore expanding the original class's logic.

```java
public class MyArrayList<E> extends ArrayList<E>{
  //Custom logic...
}
