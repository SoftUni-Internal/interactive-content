# Products Shop Project Overview

**Here is a link to the** [resources](https://videos.softuni.org/resources/java/Java-ORM-And-Spring-Data/08-DB-Advanced-JSON-Processing-Exercises-Resources.zip) **for this task.**

A products shop holds **users**, **products,** and **categories** **for the products**. 

- Users can **sell** and **buy** products.

- Users have an **id**, **first** **name** (optional), **last** **name** (at least 3 characters), and **age** (optional)

- Products have an **id**, **name** (at least 3 characters), **price**, **buyerId** (optional), and **sellerId** as IDs of users

- Categories have an **id** and **name** (from **3** to **15** characters)

Using the **Code First** approach create a database following the above description.

[image assetsSrc="Java-Spring-Data-JSON-Processing-Homework-1.jpg" /]

Configure the following relations in your models:

- **Users** should have **many products sold** and **many products bought**

- **Products** should have **many categories**

- **Categories** should have **many products**

- **Users** should have **many friends** (which are also users)

# 1. Seed the Database

**Import** the data from the provided files (**users.json**, **products.json**, **categories.json**).

Import the **users** first. When importing the products, randomly **set the buyer** and the **seller** from the existing users.

Generate some **products** that have **not been sold** (where **buyer_id** is null).

Randomly **generate categories** for each product from the existing categories.

# 2. Queries and Exported Data

Write and execute the queries below and **export** the returned data to the specified **format**.

## Query 1 - Products in Range

Get all products in a specified **price range** (500 to 1000), which have **no buyer**. 

Order them by price (from lowest to highest). 

Select only the **product name**, **price,** and the **full name** **of the seller**. 

Export the result to JSON.


**products-in-range.json**
```java
[
  {
    "name": "TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE",
    "price": 516.48,
    "seller": "Christine Gomez"
  },
  {
    "name": "Allopurinol",
    "price": 518.50,
    "seller": "Kathy Gilbert"
  },
  {
    "name": "Parsley",
    "price": 519.06,
    "seller": "Jacqueline Perez"
  },
  ...
]
```

## Query 2 - Successfully Sold Products

Get all users who have **at least 1 item sold** with a **buyer (buyer is not null)**.

Order them by **last name**, then by **first name**. 

Select the person's **first** and **last name**. 

For each of the **products** **sold** (products with buyers), select the product's **name**, **price,** and the buyer's **first** and **last name**:

**users-sold-products.json**
```java
[
  {
    "firstName": "Carl",
    "lastName": "Daniels",
    "soldProducts": [
      {
        "name": "Peter Island Continous sunscreen kids",
        "price": 471.30,
        "buyerFirstName": "Anna",
        "buyerLastName": "Parker"
      },
      {
        "name": "Warfarin Sodium",
        "price": 1379.79,
        "buyerFirstName": "Brandon",
        "buyerLastName": "Fuller"
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

## Query 3 - Categories by Products Count

Get **all categories**. 

Order them by the **number of products** in each category (a product can be in many categories). 

For each category select its **name**, the **number of products**, the **average price of those products,** and the **total revenue** 

The total revenue is the sum of the total price of all the products. It does not matter if they have a buyer associated with them or not.

**categories-by-products.json**
```java
[
  {
    "category": "Sports",
    "productsCount": 49,
    "averagePrice": 754.327755,
    "totalRevenue": 36962.06

  {
    "category": "Adult",
    "productsCount": 46,
    "averagePrice": 905.283478,
    "totalRevenue": 41643.04
  },
  ...
]
```

## Query 4 - Users and Products

Get all users who have **at least 1 product sold**. 

Order them by the **number of products sold** (from highest to lowest), then by **last name** (ascending). 

Select only their **first** and **last name**, **age** and for each product - **name** and **price**.

Export the results to **JSON**. Follow the format below to better understand how to structure your data:

**users-and-products.json**
```json
{
  "usersCount": 35,
  "users": [
    {
      "firstName": "Carl",
      "lastName": "Daniels",
      "age": 59,
      "soldProducts": {
        "count": 10,
        "products": [
          {
            "name": "Finasteride",
            "price": 1374.01
          },
          {
            "name": "Peter Island Continous sunscreen kids",
            "price": 471.30
          },
          {
            "name": "Warfarin Sodium",
            "price": 1379.79
          },
          {
            "name": "Gilotrif",
            "price": 1454.77
          },
          {
            "name": "Cold and Cough",
            "price": 218.14
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "firstName": null,
      "lastName": "Harris",
      "age": 0,
      "soldProducts": {
        "count": 9,
        "products": [
          {
            "name": "Clarins Paris Skin Illusion - 114 cappuccino",
            "price": 811.42
          },
          ...
        ]

# Car Dealer Project Overview

A car dealer needs information about cars, their parts, parts suppliers, customers and sales.

- **Each car** has a **make****, a **model****, **and travelled distance** in kilometers

- **Parts** have a **name**, **price** and **quantity**

- Part **suppliers** have a **name** an indication of whether they import parts from abroad or not

- **Customer**s have a **name**, **date of birth,** and info whether they are a **a young driver or not**

- A young driver is a driver that has **less than 2 years of experience**, those customers get an **additional 5% off** from each sale

- **Sales** have a **car**, a **customer,** and a **discount percentage**

- The **price of a car** is formed by the **total price of its parts**

Using the **Code First** approach create a database following the above description.

[image assetsSrc="Java-Spring-Data-JSON-Processing-Homework-2.jpg" /]

Configure the following relations in your models:

- A **car** has **many parts**, and **one part** can be placed **in many cars**

- **One supplier** can supply **many parts** and each **part** can be delivered by **only one supplier**

- In **one sale**, only **one car** can be sold

- **Each sale** has **one customer**, and **a customer** can buy **many cars**

# 1. Data Import

Import data from the provided files (**suppliers.json, parts.json, cars.json, customers.json**).

Import **the** **suppliers** first. When importing the **parts**, set a **random supplier** for each part from the already imported suppliers.

When importing the cars add **between 10 and 20 random parts** to each car. Then, import **all customers**.

Finally, import the **sales records** by **randomly** selecting a **car, customer** and the amount of **discount to be applied** (discounts can be 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50%).
