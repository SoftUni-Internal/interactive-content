# Declaring and Invoking Methods

# Creating Methods

A method must be declared within a class.

It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses **()**.

Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as ``System.out.println()``, but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:

```Java
public class MyClass {
  public static void printHello() {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");

  }
}
```

- `public` - defines access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application

- `void` - means that this method does not have a return value

- `printHello()` - is the name of the method and the parenthesis signify that we are calling the method, in this case with no parameters

- the body of the method should always be placed between curly brackets **{ }**

# Invoking a Method

To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses **()** and a semicolon **;**

In the following example, `printHello()` is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:

```java live no-template
public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    printHello();
  }

  public static void printHello() {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

A method can also be called multiple times:

```java live no-template
public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    printHello();
    printHello();
    printHello();
  }

  public static void printHello() {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```
