## In this lesson you learned:

- **Design patterns:** proven approaches to **common software problems** that allow us to benefit from the knowledge and **experience** of other programmers who have over time come up with different patterns

- They are not **concrete solutions** and need to be implemented on a case by case basis after **comparing** their benefits and consequences from their use

- **Categories of design patterns:**
    * creational: focuses on object creation mechanisms
    * behavioral: improves communication between dissimilar objects
    * structural: deal with an object and class composition
