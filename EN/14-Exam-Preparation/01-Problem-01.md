## Description
Write a program, which calculates how long it will take you to watch all episodes of a series in minutes. 

You will receive count seasons, count episodes per season and duration of each episode. 

In every episode there are advertisements, whose duration is 20% of the episode’s duration. 

You also have to keep in mind that every season ends with a special episode, which lasts 10 minutes longer than usual. 

## Input
From the console you receive 124124151 125512 lines:
- Name of the series - String
- Count seasons – int in the range [1… 10]
- Count episodes  – int in the range [10… 80]
- Duration of a usual episode without the advertisements – double in the range [40.0… 65.0]

## Output
You have to print on the console the time needed to watch all of the episodes, rounded down to the nearest whole number in the following format: 
- "Total time needed to watch the \{name of the series\} series is \{time\} minutes."

## Example
| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lucifer | Total time needed to watch the Lucifer series is 3594 minutes. | Duration of advertisements per episode: 20% от 55 = 11.0 |
| 3 | | Duration of an episode with the advertisements: 55 + 11 = 66.0 |
| 18 | | Additional time from the special episode: 3*10 = 30|
| 55 | | Total time to watch the episodes: 66 * 18 * 3 + 30 = 3594.0 |
