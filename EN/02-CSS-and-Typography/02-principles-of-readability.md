**Readability** is one of the most important aspects of Web design usability.

Website readability is a **measure** of how easy it is for visitors to **read** and **understand** online text.

Readability depends on both a text’s **presentation** and its **context**.

**Note:** Be careful, because poor readability scares readers away from the content.

There are some **keys** of readable typography:

* **User-Friendly** headers: header size is very important. The header should be not too large, but not too small to avoid losing the spot or ruin the hierarchy of the article;

* **White space** helps the user’s eyes flow through the text. It also provides separation between elements in the layout, including graphics and text;

* **Emphasis** of important elements is another key factor. This includes highlighting links, bolding important text and showing quotes;

* Good **margins** helps to avoid walls of text. Margins are one of the best white space elements and support text elements well. Margins on either side will force the user’s eye to focus inward on the core content of the article.
