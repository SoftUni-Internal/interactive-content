# Triggers

**Triggers** are small named programs in our database, which we can create, that will define a certain action that should happen when a certain operation gets performed on the database.

We could write a trigger that would tell MySQL to act when an event acquire like an entry was added or deleted into a particular table in the database. 

We do not call triggers explicitly, they are attached to our database and called only when a specific event, which is set on trigger creation occurs.

We could say like anytime when a row gets deleted from this table we want you to insert for example new row into a table which makes triggers extremely powerful аnd extremely useful.

# MySQL Types of Triggers

These triggers can happen **BEFORE** the **event**.

Or **AFTER** the given **event**.

# Events

The events that can activate the **triggers** can either be **INSERT**, **UPDATE** or **DELETE** queries.

The syntax for creation of a trigger would be: 

```java
CREATE TABLE account (          // Here we declare a table account
acct_number INT PRIMARY KEY,    // with sn account_number PK
 totalAmount DECIMAL(10,2));    // and a totalAmount DECIMAL.

CREATE TRIGGER ins_sum BEFORE INSERT ON account     // Here we declare a BEFORE INSERT Trigger on the table account
FOR EACH ROW SET @sum = @sum + NEW.totalAmount;     // and then we set the sum to each rool to be equal to the sum and the new total amount

DROP TRIGGER ins_sum; // The syntax for dropping a trigger
```
