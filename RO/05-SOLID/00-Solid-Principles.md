# SOLID Principles Overview

In Java, classes are the **building blocks** of any application. 

If these blocks are not strong, it might be challenging for the building (i.e the **application**) in the future.

When a developer builds a software that follows a **bad design**, the code can become inflexible and more brittle, which means that **small changes in the software can result in bugs**.

For these reasons, we should follow the **SOLID** Principles.

The **SOLID** Principles are a **coding standard** that all developers should have a **clear concept** for developing software in a **way** that **avoids bad design**.

It was promoted by **Robert Martin** and is used across the object-oriented design spectrum.

When applied properly, it makes your code more **extendable**, **logical** and **easier to read**.

**S.O.L.I.D** represents five principles of Java which are:

- **S** – **Single responsibility** – a class should have only one responsibility.
- **O** – **Open–closed** - open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **L** – **Liskov substitution** – objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes, without altering the correctness of that program.
- **I** – **Interface segregation** – many specific interfaces are better than one general interface.
- **D** – **Dependency inversion** – one should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
